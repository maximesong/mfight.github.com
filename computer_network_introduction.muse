* Resource Allocation
Examples uses: x1 + x2 <= 1, x1 + x3 <= 1
** Maximize Throughput
x1 = 0, x2 = x3 = 1

** Max-min Fairness
maximizes the throughput of the flow receiving the minimum (of resources)
 - Justification
 - Used in ATM

*** example
x1 = x2 = x3 = 1/2

** Utility Function
If xf is the rate of flow f, then the utility to flow f is
Uf(xf), where Uf(xf) is a concave utility function.

max Î£ Uf(xf)

** Proportional Fairness
Uf(xf) = log(Xf)
x1 = 1/3, x2 = x3 = 2/3 ?

** Sometimes Adding More Resource Means Lower Performance

* Internet Physical Infrastructure
 - A network of networks
 - Each individually administrated network is called an Autononmous System(AS)

** Residential access
 - Cable
 - Fiber
 - DSL
 - Wireless

** compus access
 - Ethernet
 - Wireless

* Network Protocol
A network protocol defines the format and the order of messages exchanged between two or more communicating entities, as well as the actions taken on the transmission and/or receipt of a message or other events.
 - format
 - order
 - actions

* Internet Standarization Process
All standards of the Internet are published as RFC (Request for Comments), But not all RFCs are Inernet Standards.

* Past And Current
** Past
*** Facts
 - The Internet started as ARPANET in late 1960s
 - The initial link bandwidth was 50 kbps
 - The number of hosts at the end of 1969 was 4

*** Implications
 - ARPANET is sponsored by ARPA -> desgin should survive failures
 - The initial IMPs were very simple, and were made by a small company -> keep the network simple
 - Many networks -> need a network to connect networks
 - Commercialization -> architecture supporting distributed, autonomous systems


** Current
*** Facts
 - The number of hosts connected to the Internet is about 490 millions
 - The backbone speed of the current Internet is about 10 Gbps
 - The Internet is roughly hierarchical where ISPs interconnect at PoP and NAP
