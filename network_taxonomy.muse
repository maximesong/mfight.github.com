#title Taxonomy of Communication Networks
<contents>

* Overview
[[../network_texonomy.png]]

* Broadcast Networks
definition ::
Nodes share a common channel;information transmitted by a node is received by all other nodes in the network

examples ::
 - TV
 - radio

* Switched Networks
definition ::
Information is transmitted to a small sub-set(usually only one) of the nodes

**  Circuit switching
definition ::
dedicated circuit per call/session

example ::
 - telephone
 - GSM High-Speed Circuit-Switched Data(HSCSD)

feature ::
 - each link has a number of "circuits"
(sometimes we refer to a "circuit" as a channel or a line)

 - an end-to-end connection reserves one "circuit" at each link

[[../circuit_switch_link.png]]

multiplexing for sharing resources ::

 - TDM(Time-Division Multiplexing)

[[../time_division_multiplexing.png]]
 - FDM(Frequency-Division Multiplexing)
 - Others,e.g., CDM(Code-Division Multiplexing), color/lambda division

*** three phases
1. circuit establishment
2. data transfer
3. circuit termination

*** circuit switch delay
[[../circuit_switch_delay.png]]

[[../circuit_switch_data_delay.png]]

**** propagation delay
delay for the first bit to go from a source to a destination
 - d = length of physical link
 - s = propagation speed in propogation speed in medium(~2 * 10^5 km/sec)
 - propagation delay = d / s
<example>
Suppose the distance between A and B is 4000km, 
then one-way propagation delay is:
4000km / (200,000km/s) = 20ms
</example>

**** transmission delay
time to pump data onto link at reserved rate
 - R = reserved bandwidth(bps)
 - L = message length(bits)
 - time to send a packet into link = L / R
<example>
Suppose we reserve a one slot HSCSD channel
 - each HSCSD frame can transmit about 115kbs
 - a frame is divided into 8 slots, each is about 14kbs
Then the transmission delay of using one reserved slot for a message of 1 kbits:
1kbits / 14kbps = 70ms
</example>

** Packet switching
definition ::
data sent through network in discrete "chunks"

example ::
 - Internet
 - Gneneral Packet Radio Service(GPRS)

feature ::


 - Each end-to-end data *flow* (ie., a sender-receiver pair) divided into *packets*.
*** packet structure
[[../packet_switch_structure.png]]
  - header and trailer carry control information(eg., destination address, check sum)

 - At each node the entire packet is received, processed(e.g.,routing), stored briefly, and then forwarded to the next node; thus packet-switched networks are also callled *store-and-forward networks*.

[[../packet_switching.png]]

*** packet switching router
[[../packet_switching_router.png]]

*** resources
 - resources used as needed
 - on its turn, a packet used full link bandwidth


** Circuit switching vs Packet switching
||  || circuit switching || packet switching ||
| resource | partitioned | not partitioned |
| reservation / setup | need reservation(setup delay) | no reservation |
| resources contention | busy signal(session loss) | congestion(long delay and packet losses|
| service guarantee | yes | no |
| charing | time | packet |
| header | no header | per packet header |
| fast path processing | fast | per packet processing |

** Four types of delay at each hop
*** Nodal processing delay
check errors & routing
*** Queueing
time waiting for its turn at output link
*** Transmission delay
time to pump packet onto a link at link speed
*** Propagation delay
router to router propagation

The focus is on uqeueing and transmission delay.

*** Comparasion
<example>
Assume:
R = link bandswidth(bps)
L = average packet length(bits)
a = average packet arrival rate(pkt/sec)
R / L = packet service rate(pkt/sec)
</example>

<example>
Case 1(not reserve) :
Packet arrival rate: λ
Packet service rate: μ
</example>

$utilization:\ \rho = \frac{\lambda}{\mu} = \frac{a}{R / L} = \frac{La}{R}$
$p_k\lambda = p_{k+1}\mu $
$p_{k+1} = \frac{\lambda}{\mu}p_k = (\frac{\lambda}{\mu})^{k+1}p_0 = \rho^{k+1}p_0$
$p_0 = 1 - \rho$

Average queue size:
<latex inline="true" scale="1">$$ E(Q) = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty}ip_i = (1 - \rho)\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}i\rho^i = \frac{\rho}{1 - \rho}$$</latex>

Average queue delay:
$ w = \frac{L}{R}\frac{\rho}{1-\rho} $

Transmission delay:
$ \frac{L}{R} $

Queueing + transmission:
$ \frac{L}{R} \frac{1}{1-\rho} $

[[../queue_delay.svg]]

 - ρ ~ 0 : average queueing delay small
 - ρ -> 1 : delay becomes large
 - ρ > 1 : more "work" arriving than can be serviced, average delay infinite!

*** Statistical Multiplexing
**** Reservation/Dedication(aka circuit-switching)
 - n flows.
 - each flow has an arrival rate of a/n.
 - each flow uses its own reserved (sub)link with rate R/n.
 - queueing delay + transimission delay: *n* * L/R * (1 / (1 - ρ))
**** No reservation(aka packet switching)
 - all arrival into the single link with rate a.
 - the link has bandwidth R.
 - queueing delay + transimission delay: L/R * (1 / (1 - ρ))


 - On-demand time-division
 - Schedule link on a per-packet basis
 - Packets from different sources interleaved on link
 - Buffer packets that are contending for the link
 - Buffer(queue) overflow is called congestion

** Datagram nerwork
 - each packet of a flow is switched independently
  - each packet header contains complete destination address
  - receibing a packet, a router looks at the packet's destination address and searches its current routing table to determine the possible next hops, and pick one.
 - commonly, when we say packet switching we mean datagram switching
  - e.g. IP networks
 - analogy:postal mail system 
*** time delay
[[../datagram_delay.png]]

** Virtual circuit network
 - all packets from one flow are sent along a pre-established path(= virtual circuit)
  - e.g. Multiple Label Packet Switching(MPLS) in IP networks
 - fixed path determined at virtual circuit setup time, remains fixed thru flow
 - each packet carries a short tag (virtual-circuit (VC) #); tag determines next hop

*** time delay
**** three phases
 - VC establishment
 - data transfer
 - VC disconnect

**** time delay
[[../vc_delay.png]]

** Packet Switching vs. Circuit Switching
*** Advantages
 - most important advantage of packet-switching over circuit switching is stastical multiplexing, and therefore efficient bandwidth usage.
*** Disadvantages
 - potential congestion: packet delay and high loss
  - protocols needed for reliable data transfer, congestion control
  - it is possible to guarantee quality of service(QoS) in packet-switched networks and still gain statistical multiplexing, but it adds much complexity
 - packet header overhead
 - per packet processing overhead
* Questions
1. Where is the control information for circuit switching ?
2. How big is the lookup table at each rouer ?
3. How about datagram ?
4. What are the benefits of datagram switching over virtual circuit switching ?
5. What are the benefits of virtual circuit switching over datagram switching ?
