<h2>The Road Not Taken</h2>

<p class="first">Robert Frost (1874–1963).  Mountain Interval.  1920.</p>

<ol>
<li>The Road Not Taken</li>
</ol>


<p class="verse">
TWO roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br />
And sorry I could not travel both<br />
And be one traveler, long I stood<br />
And looked down one as far as I could<br />
To where it bent in the undergrowth;<br />
</p>

<p class="verse">
Then took the other, as just as fair,<br />
And having perhaps the better claim,<br />
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br />
Though as for that the passing there<br />
Had worn them really about the same,<br />
</p>

<p class="verse">
And both that morning equally lay<br />
In leaves no step had trodden black.<br />
Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br />
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br />
I doubted if I should ever come back.<br />
</p>

<p class="verse">
I shall be telling this with a sigh<br />
Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br />
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—<br />
I took the one less traveled by,<br />
And that has made all the difference.<br />
</p>

<p>5. One method of characterization is telling, which relies on exposition and direct commentary by the author.</p>

<h2>Shall I Compare Thee To A Summer's Day?</h2>

<p style="text-align: center;">
Shall I Compare Thee To A Summer's Day?
by William Shakespeare (1564-1616)
</p>


<p class="verse">
Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?<br />
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.<br />
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,<br />
And summer's lease hath all too short a date.<br />
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,<br />
And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;<br />
And every fair from fair sometime declines,<br />
By chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd;<br />
But thy eternal summer shall not fade<br />
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st;<br />
Nor shall Death brag thou wander'st in his shade,<br />
When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st:<br />
So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,<br />
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.<br />
</p>
